Particle fusion of Super-resolution data reveals the unit structure of Nup96 in Nuclear Pore Complex

#MATLAB The code is written in MATLAB, and tested to work in MATLAB R2018-R2020.

The DIPImage toolbox for MATLAB is required, please see http://www.diplib.org for installation instructions.

Praticle fusion methods is required to reconstruct the NPCs, please see: https://github.com/wexw/Joint-Registration-of-Multiple-Point-Clouds-for-Fast-Particle-Fusion-in-Localization-Microscopy/tree/main/3dcode

3D Mex file:mex_expdist for 3D code in Software for Template-Free 3D Particle Fusion in Localization Microscopy is required for 3D classification, please see https://github.com/imphys/smlm_datafusion3d

#Example Usage Example of how to use the code is shown in the MATLAB script Demo.m You can run the demo to get all the resualts and figures shown in the manuscript.

All the results and figrues are in the floder 'Results', except the file 'data2save416' as this file is too large to upload on the Github. You can generate it by running the Demo.
